# Generator of m3u8 playlists
# By Rey Estrada 
# Github: reyestrada

# Instructions:
# Execute against the main directory
# m3u8gen.sh Music  // where Music is the directory of music
# if not directory provided, script will be executed in current path
# This will read all folders and subfolders (maxdepth = 3) 
# and will generate a playlist per folder
# Playlists will be placed in the current directory
# Playlist names will be the same as playlist folder
# Recommendation: keep names and folders short

	cd "$1"
